		<h1>20 - HTML-CSS Depreciated Cod</h1>
		<p class="paragraph">This is a tutorial on depreciated code - When a code becomes redundant because they are replaced by more modern techniques.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">So far we have learnt how to create websites using things such as float to place containers on the webpage.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">In the past few years there are new methods to solve some of the placement errors using float.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">METHOD 1 is called CSS grid and is usefull for responsive websites that can work on a mobile, pad or desktop.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">One thing about updates is that we need to ensure that all browsers can support these new methods. For example CSS grid.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">To check if a browser is compatible with a new coding method we can use the website: www.caniuse.com</p>
		<img src="images/01_caniuse.jpg">
		<p class="paragraph">This website tells us if it can be used and what version of the browser supports it.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">METHOD 2 is called flexbox which allows us to position something horizontally and vertically inside the browser and is much better than using float.
