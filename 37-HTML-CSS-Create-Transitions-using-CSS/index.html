				<h3>02a. We can use a transition-property in CSS. we can set any property but in this case we set it to all.</h3>
				<h3>02b. Transition-duration is the amount of time that it takes to transition from one image to the other, in this case two seconds.</h3>
				<h3>02c. We can also set the transition-timing-function such as in steps or ease in and out.</h3>
				<h3>02d. We can also add a transition-delay. In this case the transition will not start until the mouse has been hovering over the element for 4 seconds.</h3>

				<h3>03. There could be compatability issues because some older versions of Chrome, Mozilla firefox, Opera etc may not support the trasitions CSS feature. So we have to use webkit for chrome, moz for firefox and o for opera.</h3>

				<h3>04. This is a lot of additional code to have full compatability witl all the browser versions so we can abreviate the previous 4 lines of css code for transition into 1 line. Now we only have to add our compatability lines after.</h3>
