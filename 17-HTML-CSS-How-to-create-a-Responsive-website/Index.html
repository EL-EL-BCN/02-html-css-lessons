				<h2>17 - HTML-CSS How to make a Website Responsive</h2>
				<p>In this lesson we are going to learn how to create a resposive website because today most people will be viewing on mobile devices, tablets, desktops and laptops.</p>
				<p>On a responsive website we need to think about the layout when it is on a laptop and how that content is moved around when the screen size redices to that of a tablet. Also we need to think about what content will be dropped when we get to a small mobile screen size. With this in mind we need to design for a cell phone first then larger devices like a tablet and computer.</p>
