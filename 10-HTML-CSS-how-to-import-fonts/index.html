		<h1>How to import fonts into a website</h1>
		<p class="paragraph">This is a tutorial on how to import fonts into your website which is something that can help give your website more personality and stand out.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Method 1 - Download a file with the font in it this way is that we can still see the font if we do not have internet connection. The issue with this is that it may make our website a little slower as the font takes slightly longer to load.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Method 2 - Link to an online library where we have our font. It is faster as developers by just adding a link.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">This is a list of safe fonts that work in most browsers: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp</p>
		<p class="paragraph">This is a list of google custom fonts: https://fonts.google.com/</p>
		<p class="paragraph">This is a list of dafont custom fonts: https://www.dafont.com//</p>
		
		<p class="paragraph">To chose a google font we copt the top bit of code (1) as a link at the top of our HTML document ABOVE our style sheet href then copy the CSS code (2) into our CSS style sheet.</p>
		<br>
		<img src="1-google_font_selector.jpg">
		<br>
		<p class="paragraph">We can also customise the font on the google webpage depending on the font there are variables that can be set. When we set these variables the font href link and CSS code also changes.</p>
