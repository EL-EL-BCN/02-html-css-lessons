		<h1>PAGE 2</h1>
		<p class="page2">Method 1 - Download a file with the font in it this way is that we can still see the font if we do not have internet connection. The issue with this is that it may make our website a little slower as the font takes slightly longer to load.</p>
		<p class="page2">We download and unzip the font file droping it in a fonts folder. Now we can refference to that font in the CSS code by first setting a source to the font file then giving this font a font-family name.</p>

		<p class="page2">Now anything on our page that has a class of "page2" will have the font applied to it because I have used the font-family code in the CSS.</p>
