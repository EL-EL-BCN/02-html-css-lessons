		<h1 class="h1">11 - HTML-CSS How to create sub pages - index</h1>
		<p class="p">In this lesson we are hoing to learn how to add more pages to our website.</p>
		<p class="p">The home page must be called index.html or index.php. This is because when our website is on a server then the server will always look for a file called index in the root folder.</p>
		<p class="p">subsequent pages can be called whatever you want however they should avoid capital letters and weird symbols which may get changed when the file is saved. For example a contacts page could be called "contacts".</p>		
		<p class="p">To add a link we use an anchor tag denoted by an "a". Within the anchor tag we add a hyper reference, href, that has the name of the page we want to link to. If the page is in another folder we need to also include the path to that page. E.g. pages/page2.html</p>
		<p class="p">We can exclude some of the text from the hyper reference.</p>

		<a href="page2.html">Page 2</a>
